# Contributing to Claw Code

Thanks for helping improve Claw Code. This repository is a Rust-first CLI
workspace with supporting docs and compatibility fixtures.

## Ground rules

- Keep changes small, reviewable, and tied to a concrete issue or behavior.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, session transcripts with credentials, or
  generated build output.
- Prefer existing crate boundaries and utilities before adding dependencies.
- Update documentation when a user-facing command, config key, or provider
  behavior changes.
- Keep examples copy/paste safe. Use placeholder keys such as `sk-ant-...` and
  avoid commands that require live credentials unless the text explicitly says
  so.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultraworkers/claw-code
cd claw-code/rust
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

On Windows PowerShell, build from the same `rust` workspace and run the binary
with the `.exe` suffix:

```powershell
cd claw-code\rust
cargo build --workspace
.\target\debug\claw.exe --help
```

## Checks before opening a pull request

Run the smallest relevant tests for your change, then the broader checks when
you touch shared runtime, CLI, or docs surfaces:

```bash
cd rust
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace
```

For documentation and release-readiness changes, also run:

```bash
python .github/scripts/check_doc_source_of_truth.py
python .github/scripts/check_release_readiness.py
```

## Pull request guidance

- Describe the user-visible reason for the change.
- List the commands you ran and any known gaps.
- Call out compatibility risks for CLI output, JSON schemas, plugin contracts,
  provider behavior, or Windows/PowerShell examples.
- Keep unrelated cleanup out of feature or fix pull requests.
